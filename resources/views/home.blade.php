    <h1>Our rules:</h1><br><br>
    <p> Rule 1 - ALL POSTS MUST BE MEMES <br> <br>
        All posts must be text and follow a general text setup. <br>
        
        Someone saying something funny on twitter/tumblr/reddit/etc. is not a post. <br>
        
        <br> <br>
        Rule 2 - POST SHOULD BE GENERAL, NOT SPECIFIC PERSONAL EXPERIENCES <br>
        Please make posts general rather than specific personal experiences. This helps make posts more relatable. <br>
        
        
        <br><br>
        Rule 3 - NO SPAM/WATERMARKS, NO CHAINPOSTING/SPLIT POSTS, NO UNMARKED NSFW <br><br>
        Do not spam this sub. Linking to your social media, or spamming links with it watermarked can result in a ban <br>
        
        No 'split' or 'linked' posts - either between yourself or other users. <br>
        
        No Chainposting <br>
              
        No spam bots <br>
        
       <br><br>
        Rule 4 - NO RACISM/HATE SPEECH/TROLLING/HARASSMENT OR SUBREDDIT/SITE RAIDING <br><br>
        Please do not troll, harass, or be generally rude to your fellow users. <br>
        
        Do not post raid messages or encourage others to flood or spam another subreddit or website. <br>
        
        Keep comments civil and be respectful of your fellow users. <br>
        
        Don't post racist or bigoted posts. Those belong elsewhere. <br>
        
       <br><br>
        Rule 5 - PLEASE DO NOT POST OR REQUEST PERSONAL INFORMATION <br><br>
        Please do not post or request personal information, yours or others. <br>
        
        All posts containing social media IDs/usernames will be removed. <br>
      
        
        <br> <br>
        Rule 6 - DIRECT IMAGE LINKS ONLY + NO GIF/VIDEO POSTS <br><br>
        Please link to images directly. Direct links make browsing easier for those using RES or a mobile device. <br>
       
    <br><br>
        
        Rule 8 - NO REPOSTS <br> <br>
        Please avoid re-posting posts. <br>
        
        We want original content. Serial reposters may be banned. <br>
        
        Seriously. <br>
